# portfolio_form_design

Redesign proposal for the **New model portfolio** flow, plus the design system behind it.

Live page: https://serhiihaniuk.github.io/portfolio_form_design/

A React app built on a Tailwind CSS 4 design system with [Base UI](https://base-ui.com) components. Everything is clickable; data is illustrative.

| What | Where |
|---|---|
| App source | [`app/`](app) — see [app/README.md](app/README.md) |
| How the design system works | [app/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md](app/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md) |
| Built app served by GitHub Pages | `index.html` + `assets/` (generated — don't edit) |
| Earlier single-file HTML prototype | [`prototype.html`](https://serhiihaniuk.github.io/portfolio_form_design/prototype.html) |

## Updating the live page

```bash
cd app

npm run publish:pages   # builds, then copies app/dist to the repo root (index.html + assets/)
```

Then commit and push; GitHub Pages serves the repo root.
